# Orig User Avatar

**This WordPress plugin is a fork of the popular wp-user-avatar plugin, before it became [ProfilePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/).**

----

**Compatibility with wp-user-avatar:**

This plugin folder and file is named `orig-user-avatar/orig-user-avatar.php` instead of `wp-user-avatar/wp-user-avatar.php`. We need this change, to avoid auto-updating this fork to ProfilePress.

For best compatibility, all other parts of the plugin are unchanged: It uses the same text-domain, same class names, same constants, etc.

## How to install it:

1. Download the [plugin zip file](https://github.com/stracker-phil/orig-user-avatar/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. Open up **wp-admin | Plugins | Add New** on your WordPress site.
1. Upload the zip file.
1. Make sure to **disable ProfilePress** before activating this plugin!
