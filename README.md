# Orig User Avatar

**This WordPress plugin is a fork of the popular wp-user-avatar plugin, before it became [ProfilePress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/).**

## How to install it:

1. Download the [plugin zip file](https://github.com/stracker-phil/orig-user-avatar/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
1. Open up **wp-admin | Plugins | Add New** on your WordPress site.
1. Upload the zip file.
1. Make sure to **disable ProfilePress** before activating this plugin!

## Next Steps

I will submit this plugin to the WordPress repository to enable auto-updates via WordPress. I'll do my best to keep the plugin compatible with the latest version of WordPress but do not plan on adding new features. I think it's a great plugin as it is.

As this is a side-project, I welcome you to submit pull requests to help improve and maintain this great plugin.
